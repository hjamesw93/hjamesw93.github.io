I am a software engineer / web developer, Computer Science graduate and amateur photographer from Berkshire, England. I'm currently based in Angus, Scotland.

I currently work remotely for [Memiah Ltd](http://www.memiah.co.uk/).

I am available for freelance work and specialise in web development in PHP, with experience in Symfony, Laravel & Wordpress.

Outside of work I am interested in Landscape photography - currently exploring Scotland! My photography can be seen below:
