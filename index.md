I am a software engineer, computer science graduate and amateur photographer from the UK, currently based in Scotland.

I work remotely for [Memiah Ltd](http://www.memiah.co.uk/).

I am available for contract work and specialise in web development in PHP and Node.js.

Outside of work I have a keen interest in photography. I mostly post on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/j1mb093) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jhardingphoto/).
