I am a software engineer, recent Computer Science Graduate and amateur photographer based in Berkshire, England.

I currently work for [Memiah Ltd](http://www.memiah.co.uk/).

Outside of work I like to keep a number of projects going, The most recent one being Wallboarder - a WYSIWYG editor for wallboards and dashboards. It's early days but is getting some use and can be found here on my GitHub profile:

I am a keen photographer and have recently been experimenting with a new wide angle lens. Check out my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/j1mb093) page.
